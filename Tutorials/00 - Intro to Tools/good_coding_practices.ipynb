    "This is a small guide on *how-to-code*. Although it's quite succint, there are a few things you should know:\n",
    " * Remember that the *you* from two months ago does not reply to emails about what this function does and what that variable is.\n",
    " * Don't try to be a perfectionist when first learning a new language (there is no need to spend weeks going through documentation).\n",
    " * These are *good enough* practices to ease your code maintenance and collaboration. You'll have your whole career to find out the *best* practices (if they even exist...).\n",
    " * Follow the KISS principle (Keep it simple, *sâ€™ilvousplait*).\n",
    " * The goal of coding is not to code faster but to write maintainable code that can be understood and modified more easily in the future, potentially by developers other than you.\n",
    " * Consistency is king. Even if your approach is not the best, by keeping it consistent people will be able to understand and deal with your code much more easily."

    "Especially if you are a beginner, using text editors (or IDEs) may help you a lot in the process. PyCharm, for example, gives you easy acces to code predictions and methods' documentation. Aside from that, the way you structure your code should follow certain guidelines. PEP8 is the latest official standard for Python. In a nutshell, this standard suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use either spaces or tabs to indent your code (but be consistent with your choice):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " def space_indented():\n",
    "       pass\n",
    " ```\n",
    " **Note:** Although using tabs is not the end of the world, mixing tabs and spaces might very well be.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Surround top-level functions and class definitions with two blank lines, while only leaving one line for other methods/functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # CODE ABOVE\n",
    " \n",
    " class MyClass:\n",
    "     \n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "         \n",
    " # CODE BELOW\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Imports should be on top, one per line and in increasing order of specificity:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import library\n",
    " import library as lb\n",
    " from library import module\n",
    " from library import module_one, module_two\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * String delimiters should not matter, unless you want to avoid manually escaping characters with '\\':\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " print('Single quotes look nice.')\n",
    " print(\"So do double quotes.\")\n",
    " print('But backslashes in the middle of code don\\'t.')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * White spaces are good when used properly (like after a punctuation mark) but should be avoided when unnecessary:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Do not inline *if*, *for* and *while*:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " if foo == 'blah':\n",

    " if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()\n",
    " else: do_non_blah_thing()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Commenting should be used whenever necessary (but it's not always necessary):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " x = x + 1\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " x = x + 1 # Increment by one\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Naming should obey these simple patterns:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Variables should be named in lower case\n",
    " variable_name = None\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    " # Constants should be name in all caps\n",
    " CONSTANT_NAME = None\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should stay away from global variables (and assign default parameter values instead):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " def inc(x, step = 1):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",

    " step = 1\n",
    " def inc(x):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should avoid using absolute file paths and use relative paths instead:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " with open('./files/info.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
